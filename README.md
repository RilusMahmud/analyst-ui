# Open Traffic Analyst UI

A part of the [OTv2 platform](https://github.com/opentraffic/otv2-platform). Replaces OTv1's [Traffic Engine App](https://github.com/opentraffic/traffic-engine-app).

Analyst UI is a browser-based tool that can fetch and display public data extracts (all in Protocol Buffer format) produced by the [Open Traffic Datastore](https://github.com/opentraffic/datastore/).

## Developing

Analyst UI uses the [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) libraries, as well as [Tangram](https://github.com/tangrams/tangram) for map display. For local development, [see this readme on using the Create React App tool](https://github.com/opentraffic/analyst-ui/blob/master/README-create-react-app.md).
